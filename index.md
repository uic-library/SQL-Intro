-------------------------------------------
Drastic increase in data in the real world led to building an organized way of data called relational databases. To draw insights from these databases, one should be able to retrieve this huge data efficiently and this can be done using SQL language. This workshop is designed to introduce you to the concept of SQL and how it is useful in database management. It includes basics of SQL, explanation of data retrieval and manipulation using SQL queries along with concepts of Operators and Joins using hands-on examples.

We will be using W3School's SQL editor for implementing the SQL queries on predefined databases present in the editor. W3Shcool's SQL editor is a open source online editor and is available for everyone for free of cost.
