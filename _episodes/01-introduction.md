## INTRODUCTION TO SQL

A query is really a question or request for data. For example, "Tell me how many books there are on computer programming" or "How many Rolling Stones albums were produced before 1980?" When we query databases, we can use a common language to get the information.

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is the standard language used in a
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). SQL is used to communicated with the
database and perform necessary operations such as update existing data (or) retrieve data.


A database generally comprises of multiple tables and each table consists of multiple
records (rows) and attributes (columns). SQL helps perform operations on the tables of the
database.
